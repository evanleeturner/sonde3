# sonde3

> sonde3 is a python3 library for extracting and processing binary data from scientific environmental logging instruments.

> sonde3 is a python3 port of the package [sonde](https://github.com/twdb/sonde) that was originally developed in 2010.  Sonde3 is a library for interacting with instrument data collected by scientific environmental data loggers (e.g., YSI, Hydrolab, Eureka, Greenspan).  sonde3 can auto-convert between raw, proprietary data formats and comma separated files.
Sonde3 is used principally to support instrument files collected since 1986 by the Texas Water Development Board which is housed on the [Coastal Water Data for Texas website](https://waterdatafortexas.org/coastal).
