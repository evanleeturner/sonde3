# For each data record that needs to be tested, the first value should
# be the datetime in the "MM/DD/YYYY hh:mm:ss" format, followed by a
# comma delimited list of parameter values in column order as
# above. If there are parameter values that are not available for some
# reason (e.g. a sensor goes out), enter the value as "nan". This list
# should include AT LEAST the first three records of data, a set of
# three records from some random location in the file and the last
# three records of data
